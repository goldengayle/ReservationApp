## Description
This is a full stack application that allows users to make reservations at a restaurant. The user can also make a deposit on their meal. The owner can update the menu of the restaurant with a simple jpeg image each week. The owner can also highlight images of the restaurants food to attract customers. The owner can see a table with all current reservations.

## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A USER I want to make a reservation for the restaurant 
AS A USER I want to put a deposit on my meal for the restaurant
AS A USER I want to receive confirmation for my deposit and restaurant table with an email.
AS A USER I want to be able to sign in to my account to see my reservation.
AS AN OWNER I want to update the menu of my restaurant with a simple jpeg image each week. 
AS AN OWNER I want to highlight images of the restaurants food to attract customers
AS AN OWNER I want to see a table with all current reservations.
```

## Project Requirements

Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### CSS Styling

Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

* Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

* Try using a component library, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

* Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose&mdash;it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

### Payment Platform

Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

### Bonus

Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

* Uses a web manifest

* Uses a service worker for offline functionality

* Is installable

## Acceptance Criteria

This project is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 25%

* Satisfies the following code requirements:

  * Application uses React for the front end.

  * Application has a GraphQL API with a Node.js and Express.js server, and uses queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

  * Application uses MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database and protects sensitive API key information on the server.

  * Application includes user authentication using JWT.

### Concept 10%

* Application should be a unique and novel idea.

* Your group should clearly and concisely articulate your project idea.

### Deployment: 20%

* Application deployed at live URL on Heroku and loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

### Repository Quality: 10%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains a high-quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

### Application Quality: 15%

* Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

* Application user interface style is clean and polished.

* Application is responsive.

### Presentation 10%

* Your group should present using a slide deck.

* Every group member should speak during the presentation.

* Your presentation should follow the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing).

### Collaboration 10%

* There are no major disparities in the number of GitHub contributions between group members.

### Bonus

Fulfilling all three of the following requirements to turn your app into a PWA will add 10 points to your grade. Note that the highest grade you can achieve is still a 100:

* Uses a web manifest

* Uses a service worker for offline functionality

* Is installable

## How to Submit Your MERN Stack Single-Page Application
